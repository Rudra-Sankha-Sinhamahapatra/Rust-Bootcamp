# Rust Bootcamp

## Rust Learning Syllabus

### Easy

1. **Installing Rust**

   - Download and install Rust from the [official site](https://www.rust-lang.org/).

2. **IDE Setup**

   - We will be using Visual Studio Code (VS Code) as our IDE.

- You might need to install VS Code development tools for C or C++. If you have MinGW already on your local machine, you can download a toolchain with the following commands (if your desktop is Windows 64-bit). For more details, visit their website or search the web:

```bash
rustup toolchain install stable-x86_64-pc-windows-gnu
```

```bash
rustup default stable-x86_64-pc-windows-gnu
```

- Verify the installation:

```bash
rustc --version
```

```bash
cargo --version
```

- Install the Rust extension for VS Code for better development experience.

3. **Initializing a Project Locally**

   ```bash
    mkdir new_folder
    cd new_folder
    cargo init
   ```

   or

   ```bash
   cargo new new_folder
   cd new_folder
   ```
